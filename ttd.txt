things to do (backend):
 
1. create a sql database, with tables of the following data:
    1. all the pokemon, through all generations
    2. the playthrough order in every game with all the cities
    3. each city and it's pokemon 
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    (now with the updated databases)
    4. a player's party
    5. a player's total team playthrough (dead pokemon, inactive, etc)
    5. a player's statistics (playthroughs ran, highest gym, etc)
    6. player's account data (?)

    - synchronized pokemon data to fetch pokemons evolution(s), and evolution level

7/10/25:
    - start using direct api calls with requests; average call is SEVEN seconds faster *jesus*
